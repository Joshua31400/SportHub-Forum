## ðŸ“š About the project

This project was developed during the Forum project at Ynov Campus. The goal was to create a comprehensive forum for sports enthusiasts, where they can discuss all aspects of sports without limitations. Users can share their thoughts on various topics including nutrition advice, training tips, equipment reviews, and personal experiences.

The platform serves as a community hub where sports fans can:
- Share photos of their sporting activities or events
- Receive notifications when their content gets engagement
- Like and interact with posts from other community members

The final project repository can be founded [here](https://ytrack.learn.ynov.com/git/bjoshua/SportHub-Forum.git)
